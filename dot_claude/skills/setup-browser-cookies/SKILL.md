If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest wstack skills AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /qa, /ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: tell the user "A new version of wstack is available ({old} to {new}). Update: `cd ~/.claude/skills/wstack && git pull && ./setup`". If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running wstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If output shows `GH_CLI_MISSING`: tell the user: "wstack needs the GitHub CLI (gh) to check for updates. Install it: `brew install gh` (macOS) or see https://cli.github.com. Then run `gh auth login` to authenticate." Continue with the skill but warn that update checks won't work until gh is installed.

If output shows `GH_CLI_NOT_AUTHENTICATED`: tell the user: "GitHub CLI is installed but not authenticated. Run `gh auth login` to connect your GitHub account. This is needed for wstack to check for updates from the private repo." Continue with the skill but warn that update checks won't work until authenticated.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: silently mark it as seen and continue. No prompt needed.

```bash
touch ~/.wstack/.completeness-intro-seen
```

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no`: auto-enable telemetry for internal WakeCap users and mark as prompted. No question needed.

```bash
"$_WSTACK_BIN/wstack-config" set telemetry community 2>/dev/null || true
touch ~/.wstack/.telemetry-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no`: auto-enable proactive mode and mark as prompted. No question needed.

```bash
"$_WSTACK_BIN/wstack-config" set proactive true 2>/dev/null || true
touch ~/.wstack/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, the user has namespaced skill names. When suggesting
or invoking other wstack skills, use the `/wstack-` prefix (e.g., `/wstack-qa` instead
of `/qa`, `/wstack-ship` instead of `/ship`). Disk paths are unaffected — always use
`~/.claude/skills/wstack/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` for reading skill files.

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, sharp, never corporate, never academic. Sound like a builder, not a consultant. Name the file, the function, the command. No filler, no throat-clearing.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods, "..."). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision... the user decides.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your wstack experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** wstack tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but wstack failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.wstack/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, reflect on this session:
- Did any commands fail unexpectedly?
- Did you take a wrong approach and have to backtrack?
- Did you discover a project-specific quirk (build order, env vars, timing, auth)?
- Did something take longer than expected because of a missing flag or config?

If yes, log an operational learning for future sessions:

```bash
eval "$(~/.claude/skills/wstack/bin/wstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
mkdir -p "${WSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.wstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}"
echo '{"skill":"setup-browser-cookies","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> "${WSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.wstack}/projects/${SLUG:-unknown}/learnings.jsonl" 2>/dev/null || true
```

Replace SKILL_NAME with the current skill name. Only log genuine operational discoveries.
Don't log obvious things or one-time transient errors (network blips, rate limits).
A good test: would knowing this save 5+ minutes in a future session? If yes, log it.

## Telemetry (run last)

After the skill workflow completes (success, error, or abort), log the telemetry event.
Determine the skill name from the `name:` field in this file's YAML frontmatter.
Determine the outcome from the workflow result (success if completed normally, error
if it failed, abort if the user interrupted).

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.wstack/analytics/` (user config directory, not project files). The skill
preamble already writes to the same directory — this is the same pattern.
Skipping this command loses session duration and outcome data.

Run this bash:

```bash
# Re-source session env in case this bash block runs in a fresh shell
[ -f ~/.wstack/sessions/.last.env ] && . ~/.wstack/sessions/.last.env 2>/dev/null || true
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - ${_TEL_START:-$_TEL_END} ))
_ANALYTICS_DIR="${WSTACK_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.wstack}/analytics"
rm -f "$_ANALYTICS_DIR/.pending-$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
# Session timeline: record skill completion (local-only, never sent anywhere)
"$_WSTACK_BIN/wstack-timeline-log" '{"skill":"setup-browser-cookies","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
# Local analytics (gated on telemetry setting)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ]; then
mkdir -p "$_ANALYTICS_DIR"
echo '{"skill":"setup-browser-cookies","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","source":"epilogue"}' >> "$_ANALYTICS_DIR/skill-usage.jsonl" 2>/dev/null || true
fi
# Remote telemetry (opt-in, requires binary)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ] && [ -n "$_WSTACK_BIN" ] && [ -x "$_WSTACK_BIN/wstack-telemetry-log" ]; then
"$_WSTACK_BIN/wstack-telemetry-log" \
  --skill "setup-browser-cookies" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
  --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Replace `OUTCOME` with success/error/abort, and `USED_BROWSE` with true/false based on whether `$B` was used.
If you cannot determine the outcome, use "unknown". The local JSONL always logs. The
remote binary only runs if telemetry is not off and the binary exists.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## WSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
"$_WSTACK_BIN/wstack-review-read"
\`\`\`

Then write a `## WSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## WSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |
| DX Review | \`/plan-devex-review\` | Developer experience gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# Setup Browser Cookies

Import logged-in sessions from your real Chromium browser into the headless browse session.

## CDP mode check

First, check if browse is already connected to the user's real browser:
```bash
$B status 2>/dev/null | grep -q "Mode: cdp" && echo "CDP_MODE=true" || echo "CDP_MODE=false"
```
If `CDP_MODE=true`: tell the user "Not needed — you're connected to your real browser via CDP. Your cookies and sessions are already available." and stop. No cookie import needed.

## How it works

1. Find the browse binary
2. Run `cookie-import-browser` to detect installed browsers and open the picker UI
3. User selects which cookie domains to import in their browser
4. Cookies are decrypted and loaded into the Playwright session

## Steps

### 1. Find the browse binary

## SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)

```bash
_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
B=""
[ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/wstack/browse/dist/browse" ] && B="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/wstack/browse/dist/browse"
[ -z "$B" ] && B=~/.claude/skills/wstack/browse/dist/browse
if [ -x "$B" ]; then
  echo "READY: $B"
else
  echo "NEEDS_SETUP"
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SETUP`:
1. Tell the user: "wstack browse needs a one-time build (~10 seconds). OK to proceed?" Then STOP and wait.
2. Run: `cd <SKILL_DIR> && ./setup`
3. If `bun` is not installed: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

### 2. Open the cookie picker

```bash
$B cookie-import-browser
```

This auto-detects installed Chromium browsers and opens
an interactive picker UI in your default browser where you can:
- Switch between installed browsers
- Search domains
- Click "+" to import a domain's cookies
- Click trash to remove imported cookies

Tell the user: **"Cookie picker opened — select the domains you want to import in your browser, then tell me when you're done."**

### 3. Direct import (alternative)

If the user specifies a domain directly (e.g., `/setup-browser-cookies github.com`), skip the UI:

```bash
$B cookie-import-browser comet --domain github.com
```

Replace `comet` with the appropriate browser if specified.

### 4. Verify

After the user confirms they're done:

```bash
$B cookies
```

Show the user a summary of imported cookies (domain counts).

## Notes

- On macOS, the first import per browser may trigger a Keychain dialog — click "Allow" / "Always Allow"
- On Linux, `v11` cookies may require `secret-tool`/libsecret access; `v10` cookies use Chromium's standard fallback key
- Cookie picker is served on the same port as the browse server (no extra process)
- Only domain names and cookie counts are shown in the UI — no cookie values are exposed
- The browse session persists cookies between commands, so imported cookies work immediately
